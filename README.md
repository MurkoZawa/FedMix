# FedMix
The respective experiments are conducted in jupyter notebook.

To run the experiments: 

**Optional**: Open the Data_Augmentation notebook and augment the data (in the data folder, there already are the augmented images and labels) and run the cell. If you do that, make sure to move them on the imagesTrAug and labelsTrBW folders.
- Open the notebook of the federated or local learning methodology you want to use, and run all the cells.
- Once you trained your model, test it and calculate the performance measures by running all the cells in the metrics_calculator notebook.
